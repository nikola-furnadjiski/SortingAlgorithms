/**
 * Bucket sort is mainly useful when input is uniformly distributed over a range. For example, consider the following
 * problem. Sort a large set of floating point numbers which are in range from 0.0 to 1.0 and are uniformly distributed
 * across the range. How do we sort the numbers efficiently?
 * <p>
 * A simple way is to apply a comparison based sorting algorithm. The lower bound for Comparison based sorting algorithm
 * (Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick-Sort .. etc) is Î©(n Log n), i.e., they cannot do better than nLogn. Can we sort the
 * array in linear time? Counting sort can not be applied here as we use keys as index in counting sort. Here keys are
 * floating point numbers. The idea is to use bucket sort. Following is bucket algorithm.
